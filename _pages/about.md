Welcome to my website <span class="wave">👋🏼</span>

I'm currently a Research Data Engineer at <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">The University of Sheffield</a>. My main responsibility is to develop data and software products, and integrate them
into workflows to produce high quality research frameworks.

Previously, I attained my PhD in Applied Mathematics, where I utilised <a href="https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/">NASA</a> observational data from the Sun to better understand how its atmospheres are heated to multi-million degree temperatures. 
I also hold an MSci in Physics with Astrophysics from <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk//">Glasgow University</a>.

I'm passionate about making technical content accessible for everyone.
